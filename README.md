## Overview

JarviSuite is a cross-platform assistant designed to work seamlessly across devices (phone, watch, desktop). Leveraging markdown as its native interface, JarviSuite integrates task management, automation workflows, and AI-driven interactions into a single, always-on agent.

## Problem

Current digital assistants are often shallow and siloed, unable to manage deep workflows or meaningfully archive user interactions. Users are forced to switch between multiple apps with no unified context, lacking memory, automation, and continuity.

## Solution

JarviSuite addresses these gaps by providing:

* **Voice & Text Triggers**: Invoke the assistant via speech or typed commands.
* **Markdown-Native Interface**: Every interaction is stored and editable in markdown files for easy archiving and review.
* **Cross-Device Sync**: Consistent experience on phone, watch, and desktop.
* **Workflow Automation**: Integrations with email, calendar, browser actions, and more.
* **Smart Task Management**: Create, track, and receive notifications on tasks.
* **Messaging Replies**: Automate replies to texts and chats.
* **Comprehensive Archiving**: All interactions are logged and searchable.

Think of JarviSuite as **ChatGPT + Raycast + Apple Shortcuts + Notion + Zapier**â€”all in one.

## Features

* **Natural Language Commands**: Speak or type to perform actions.
* **Extensible Automations**: Build and share custom shortcuts.
* **Persistent Memory**: Context carries across sessions and devices.
* **Unified Inbox**: Centralized view of notifications and tasks.
* **Markdown Archive**: Human-readable log of all commands and outputs.

## Target Market

* Tech enthusiasts and power users
* Founders and startup teams
* Developers and engineers
* ADHD and neurodivergent users
* Remote workers and digital nomads
